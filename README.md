**MakeItLight** is a lightweight datapack for Minecraft 1.21 that allows players to craft, control, and visually detect the invisible light block (`minecraft:light`) in survival mode – all without the need for cheats or creative mode.

With this datapack, you can:
- Craft light blocks using a custom recipe (8 glass panes + 1 torch)
- Set the light level via `/trigger lightlevel set <1–15>`
- Safely remove light blocks and drop them as items via `/trigger lightlevel set 0`
- **Automatically reveal nearby invisible light blocks** when holding a light block in your hand.

Perfect for survival players who want to add hidden lighting to their builds – and now also easily find and manage it.

**Compatibility:**  
✅ Minecraft 1.21  
✅ Works in singleplayer and multiplayer  
✅ No mods required – fully vanilla-friendly
